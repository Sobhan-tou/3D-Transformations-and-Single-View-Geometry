## Projection of 3D Bounding Boxes onto 2D Image Plane
In this project, we visualize annotated 3D object bounding boxes by projecting them from world coordinates onto a 2D camera image. We use the camera's intrinsic and extrinsic parameters to transform and project each box, and overlay them on the image with color-coded labels and distance annotations. This helps in interpreting object localization and perception in real-world 3D scenes.
